# Multivariate Forecasting

The presentation breaks down some of the latest advencements in demand forecasting and how it can relate to multivariate forecasting, pricing/promos, etc.

Given I work with these topics in my current role this repo will likely focus more on hierarchical forecasting and their implimentations rather than multivariate forecasting as a broad topic.

Rough starter work for now can be found in the sandbox however implementations will include DeepAR (with changes to feature representation), TFT, DeepVar, E2E heirarchical embeddings, Poincare Embeddings, Normalizing Flows, etc. Implementations will be done in GluonTS and Pytorch.
